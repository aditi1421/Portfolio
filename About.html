        <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
        <h4>
            <p>My name is Aditi Kumar. I was born in Patna and raised up in Delhi.
                I am currently doing B.E. in Computer Science from SRM IST,KTR,Chennai.I have started learning more
                in the field of coding and it's a really fun time for me to learn new languages like Python.<br>
                I like to listen to music and travel.
                For me,travelling is something which I regularly do and honestly, it gives me a break from the
                monotonous life.
                You get to know a lot about the different places, it broadens your horizon and most
                importantly,great food.<br>
                Music has always been a part of me since childhood, right from dancing to now learning to play the
                guitar.
            </p>
